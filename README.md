#### Description
Contains Assignment submissions to the course [CS253: Software Development And Operations](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/pages/CS253.html) (2021-22 II Sem.).
The assignments were given in the languages `C++` (OOPs), `Bash` (Scripting) and `Python` (Data Science).<br>

Each of the assignments have a separate directory of their own. The assignments have been explained briefly below:

+ [<u>C++:</u>](./C%2B%2B/) A library management system had to be implemented with some classes and functions given, but we were free to expand on them.
+ [<u>Bash:</u>](./Bash/) A script that parses a given `.CSV` and prints some fields to a given output file.
+ [<u>Python:</u>](./Python/) A `.ipynb` in which templates of some functions were given that were going to be used in an ML-based classifier (that classifies emails as spam or not spam).

Not all the files included in this repository are my own. The assignment files in [Bash](./Bash/Assignment.pdf) and [C++](./C%2B%2B/Assignment.pdf) were provided in the course, and the [Jupyter Notebook](./Python/Assignment.ipynb) was also provided with some instructions, links and templates written.<br>
Further, the [file](./Bash/college.csv) used as the input for the bash script was also provided in the course.
