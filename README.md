### Description
Contains Assignment submissions to the course [CS253: Software Development And Operations](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/pages/CS253.html) (2021-22 II Sem.).
The assignments were given in the languages `C++` (OOPs), `Bash` (Scripting) and `Python` (Data Science).<br>

Each of the assignments have a separate directory of their own. All three submissions were satisfactory (with respect to the rubric atleast). The assignments have been explained briefly below:

+ [<u>C++:</u>](./C%2B%2B/) A library management system had to be implemented with some classes and functions given, but we were free to expand on them.<br>

|Login-Logout Functionality | 2.0 |
|Student's functionalities | 6.0 |
|Professor's functionalities | 6.0 |
|Book Class functionalities | 6.0 |

+ [<u>Python:</u>](./Python/) A `.ipynb` in which templates of some functions were given that were going to be used in an ML-based classifier (that classifies emails as spam or not spam). The algorithms used were SVM and KNN.
Before running, please ensure that the dataset is stored in an appropriately named file in the same directory as the [.ipynb](./Python/Assignment.ipynb).<br>
Marks Distribution:
  + Data pre-processing (11): 1.0 for `read_email()`, 2.0 for the rest of the functions
  + Visualization (5): 2.0 for all emails, 1.0 for spam emails, 1.0 for non-spam emails, 1.0 for correct annotations in graphs.
  + Classification (9): 3.0 for splitting, SVM, KNN classifier each.
  + Model Evaluation (6): 3.0 for accuracy and AUC score each.


### Acknowledgements

Not all the files included in this repository are my own. The assignment files in [Bash](./Bash/Assignment.pdf) and [C++](./C%2B%2B/Assignment.pdf) were provided in the course, and the [Jupyter Notebook](./Python/Assignment.ipynb) was also provided with some instructions, links and templates written.<br>
Further, the [file](./Bash/college.csv) used as the input for the bash script was also provided in the course.
