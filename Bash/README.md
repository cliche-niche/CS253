This assignment was based on the bash commands `sed/grep/awk`, although other commands could be used. The goal was to parse a given `.CSV` (say *input*) and write some data from it into another file (say *output*). A sample [input](./college.csv) and its corresponding [output](./output.txt) has been provided.

To run the script-
```bash
./lab.sh input.csv output.txt
```

*Note: Please ensure that the input file has all the necessary entries as mentioned in the [assignment](./Assignment.pdf).*
